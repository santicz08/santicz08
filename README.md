Hi, my name is Santiago Cardoso and im a 14 year old kid from Uruguay, last month I started my coding journey via the Harvard cs50p, I am currently still doing the course and some little projects. Im doing this github profile because of this course and because to enter my dream university, MIT, I read that a github profile works as a type of portafolio. I am really intrested in Ai and if everything goes well you are going to see some Machine Learning code in this repos
